# Overview

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
* <s>To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). 
* To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).</s>



---
Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
  - [x] Mobile: 375px
  - [x] Desktop: 1440px
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- [ ] Search for any IP addresses or <s>domains</s> and see the key information and location
<hr>

#### In Progress...
  - [ ] <i>fetch new data with ip address input
  - [ ] create observable/Subject from fetch service for latitude
  - [ ] create observable/Subject from fetch service for longitude
  - [ ] handle errors
  - [ ] remove map controls and fix pin/marker
  - [ ] Add alert styling library for error alerts 
  - [ ] Add Animations?
  - [ ] polish and test your code
  - [ ] implement domain functionality, may need to use a different API?</i>

## My process
### design
### API Selection
#### Geolocation API
To get the IP Address locations,  I decided to go with the <b>[IP geolocation API by Abstract](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation/documentation)</b> because the
[IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) had a very small lifetime limit of 1,000 ðŸ†“ requests; compared to Abstract's 22,000 ðŸ†“ requests per month *and* optional ip address query parameter.
#### Google Maps API
For the mapping API, I went with <b>[Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript)</b>, for the mapping API. I've used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) before and I wanted to try something new, I thought that a google API would pair well with Angular.
### Reactive Development with RxJs

## Built with
### APIs

- <b>[IP geolocation API by Abstract](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation/documentation)</b> to get the IP Address locations.
-  For the mapping API, I went with <b>[Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript)</b>.
- <b>[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)</b> to test API endpoints and query parameters.

### Frameworks and Librarys
- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> (<b>JavaScript</b> framework)
  - <b>[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</b>
  - <b>[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)</b>
  - <b>[RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/)</b> a library for reactive programming using Observables.
- <b>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)</b> collaborative web application for interface design.
- <b>[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)/CSS</b> custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - Responsive Styling
  - Flexbox
- Semantic <b>HTML5</b> markup

## What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->



## Continued development
- [ ] search by domain input 
- [ ] add animations
